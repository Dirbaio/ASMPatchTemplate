===========================

Stuff works similar to NDS homebrew projects.
Code goes in source/
Data goes in data/

Place a NSMB USA ROM in this folder (Other regions will NOT work)
Use a recent version of NSMB Editor to compile and insert the code into the ROM.

Included features:
nonintendo.cpp - Makes the game skip the Nintendo boot screen (for faster testing!)
debugscreen.s - Makes the debug screen show without entering the key combination
print.s - Stuff for printing to no$gba debugger / desmume console.
nsmb.h - Various unorganized crap.

Enjoy!
